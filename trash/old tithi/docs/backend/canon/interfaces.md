Source of Truth: contracts in /src/types/** and /src/api/** and /src/services/**
Edit Policy: Append-only; deprecate instead of delete
Last Updated: 2025-01-16

## Global Rules
- Append-only history. If behavior changes, add a new versioned entry and mark the old one Deprecated (keep history).
- Deterministic order. Sections sorted by feature: Tenancy, Availability, Bookings, Payments, Notifications, Usage, Audit, Policies. Within each section, A→Z by type name.
- Anchors & IDs:
  - Interfaces: I-<FEATURE>-<NAME>-vN
  - Flows: F-<FEATURE>-<NAME>
  - Constraints: C-<TOPIC>-NNN
- Cross-links. Link by ID (e.g., "See C-IDEMP-001", "See I-BOOKINGS-CreateBookingRequest-v1").
- Formatting. H2 = sections. H3 = items. Fenced code blocks for JSON. Monospace for paths (`/api/...`, `/src/...`). Bullet lists ≤ 10 items.
- Examples are canonical. One valid JSON example per interface/event; timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC; money = integer cents; enums mirror DB.

## Purpose
Contracts for cross-boundary surfaces: API request/response DTOs, events, and minimal service interfaces you read/write.

## Organization
- ## Tenancy
- ## Availability
- ## Bookings
- ## Payments
- ## Notifications
- ## Usage
- ## Audit
- ## Policies (Auth helpers that cross boundaries)

Within each section, sort items A→Z by type name.

## Item Template
### I-<FEATURE>-<Name>-v1
**Kind:** <RequestDTO | ResponseDTO | EventPayload | EventUnion | ServiceInterface>  
**Path / Topic:** `<HTTP METHOD> /api/<...>` | `<event.topic>`  
**Fields:**
- `field_name` (type) — short meaning. **Required.**
- `optional_field` (type) — when/why present. *Optional.*
**References:** See C-<TOPIC>-NNN, F-<FEATURE>-<FlowName>  
**Example:**
```json
{
  "field_name": "value",
  "optional_field": null
}
```
**Change Log:**  
- 2025-08-17 — Added (v1)

## Append Rules
- New surface? Add a new H3 item with -v1.
- Backward-compatible field? Add a new version block with bumped -vN, copy prior block, and mark the old block Deprecated with reason and link to new ID.
- Never remove enum members here; mirror DB enums exactly.

## Windsurf Prompt: "Append to interfaces.md"
Goal: Append professionally formatted entries to `docs/canon/interfaces.md`  
Rules:
- Keep header; update "Last Updated" to today.
- Insert under the correct ## <Feature> section (create if missing); sort items A→Z by type name.
- Use the "Item Template" verbatim.
- Enums mirror DB; timestamps ISO-8601 UTC; money in integer cents.
- Cross-link referenced constraints/flows by ID.
Inputs:
- Feature: <FEATURE>
- Items to add: <bulleted list: name, kind, path/topic, fields, example JSON, references>
Output:
- A single patch that appends new H3 blocks in the right section.

## Safe Update with Deprecation (when changes are required)
- Do not delete/overwrite the old block.
- Create a new versioned block (e.g., `I-<FEATURE>-<Name>-v2`).
- Mark the previous block "Deprecated — superseded by <new ID>".
- Only edit the old block's Status/Note line to add deprecation info.

## Quality Checklist
- Header present; Last Updated = today
- Correct section and alphabetical ordering
- IDs unique; cross-links valid
- Exactly one JSON example; valid & minimal
- Enums mirror DB; timestamps UTC; money integer cents
- No deletions; clear deprecations
