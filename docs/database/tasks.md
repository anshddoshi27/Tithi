## Execution Context Rule

When carrying out any task or generating files, migrations, or tests, **the AI executor (Cursor, Windsurf, or equivalent)** must always ground its work in all three canonical knowledge sources:

1. **Design Brief** → final schema, enumerations, policies, constraints, and post-0019 amendments  
2. **Context Pack** → guardrails, invariants, canon appends, migration sequence 00–19, CI rules  
3. **Cheat Sheets** →  
   - `interfaces.md` (contract surfaces, enums, tables, helpers)  
   - `constraints.md` (CHECKs, uniques, exclusions, NOT NULLs, partials)  
   - `critical_flows.md` (multi-step flows, precedence, triggers, lifecycle order)

### Executor Obligations
- **Load all three** into context before implementing.  
- **Check alignment**: ensure outputs match the Design Brief and do not violate Context Pack invariants or Cheat Sheet entries.  
- **Resolve conflicts with this priority order:**  
  1. Design Brief (final authoritative)  
  2. Context Pack (guardrails)  
  3. Cheat Sheets (coverage/expansion)  
- **Fail safe**: if any invariant or constraint would be broken, do not produce the output—surface the violation instead.  
- **Emit canon updates** (interfaces/constraints/flows counts) after each step, ensuring they reflect knowledge across all sources.

### Human Reviewers’ Role
- Confirm that each PR shows evidence the executor applied all three sources (citations to Brief, Pack, Cheat Sheets).  
- Reject outputs that rely only on partial context or contradict the Brief/Pack/Cheat Sheets.  
- CI should enforce by checking for presence of:  
  - Canon update blocks with counts  
  - “Execution Context Rule” mention in `docs/DB_PROGRESS.md`

---

## Global Rules

**Migration Rule**  
All migrations are additive-only. No destructive changes (`DROP`, `ALTER COLUMN`, `DROP TABLE`, etc.) are permitted. If schema evolution is needed, executor must propose a safe additive pattern (new column/table/enum + backfill if required).

**Testing Rule**  
Executor must produce or extend pgTAP tests whenever invariants, constraints, or flows are introduced. Tests must verify isolation, overlap, RLS policies, enum validity, PCI boundaries, and fail-safe behavior.

**Indexing Rule**  
Only create indexes explicitly permitted in the Design Brief or Context Pack. No speculative or redundant indexes.

**Environment Rule**  
Seed data (Task 18) and any debug/dev-only constructs must be strictly isolated from production. All migrations must be production-safe by default.

**RLS Rule**  
All tables must have Row Level Security enabled, deny-by-default. Policies must be fail-closed, NULL-safe, and built on the standard helpers.

---

**Applies to all tasks 00–19:**  
Before generating, always load and align with the Design Brief, Context Pack, and Cheat Sheets.  
Resolve conflicts in this order: Design Brief > Context Pack > Cheat Sheets.  
If alignment fails or invariants conflict, executor must halt and surface the violation instead of generating output.

       - End with "Count: X".

2) Append to docs/canon/constraints.md:
       - Add section "### P0016 — Constraints"
       - Bullet any new constraints created in this task.
       - End with "Count: Y".

3) Append to docs/canon/critical_flows.md:
       - Add section "### P0016 — Critical Flows"
       - Bullet any new critical flows or triggers created in this task.
       - End with "Count: Z".

In docs/DB_PROGRESS.md, under this prompt, also add:
"Canon updates for P0016 → interfaces: X, constraints: Y, flows: Z".

IMPORTANT: Before adding bullets, consult the example coverage lists in the Context Pack 
(interfaces, constraints, critical flows). 
Use those examples as guidance to decide what counts, so you don’t miss anything.

## 17 — Performance indexes (unchanged + practicals) (+ services category/active, reschedule & attendees)


Task:

```
Create infra/supabase/migrations/0017_indexes.sql adding CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS:
[original definitions...]
Output:
 – SQL
 – MD appending ## 0017 – Index Pass with brief guidance on when to add trigram/fuzzy indexes and why category/active & reschedule/attendees indexes help the UX.
Also append three fenced Markdown blocks:

1) Append to docs/canon/interfaces.md:
       - Add section "### P0017 — Interfaces"
       - Bullet any new interfaces created in this task.
       - End with "Count: X".

2) Append to docs/canon/constraints.md:
       - Add section "### P0017 — Constraints"

Task:

```
Create infra/supabase/migrations/0018_seed_dev.sql inserting:

Output:
 – SQL
 – MD appending ## 0018 – Dev Seed with notes on local testing.
Also append three fenced Markdown blocks:

1) Append to docs/canon/interfaces.md:
       - Add section "### P0018 — Interfaces"

Task:

```
Add two files under infra/supabase/tests/:

Also append three fenced Markdown blocks:

1) Append to docs/canon/interfaces.md:
       - Add section "### P0019 — Interfaces"
