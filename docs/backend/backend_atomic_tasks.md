# Tithi Backend — Complete Atomic Tasks Reference

This document contains all atomic tasks for building the Tithi backend, organized by phases with full specifications.

---

## Mission Context

Tithi is an end-to-end, fully white-labeled platform for service-based businesses (e.g., salons, clinics, studios) to launch their own branded booking systems in minutes.

Every tenant (business) has its own subdomain (business.tithi.com) or custom domain.

Customers booking services only see the business's brand, logo, colors, policies, not "Tithi" (unless explicitly chosen).

Tithi replaces multiple tools by offering onboarding, branding, bookings, payments, policies, notifications, CRM, analytics — all within one modular platform.

**North Star Goals:**
- Strict tenant data isolation.
- Full tenant-controlled branding.
- Owner/Admin only (no staff roles in v1).
- Bookings require full payment validation.
- Availability must always be defined for booking to function.
- Secure, observable, and deterministic backend execution.

## Executor Guidelines

### 1. Task Context
- Always reference the design brief and context pack before generating outputs.
- Ensure every deliverable aligns with Tithi's mission, business rules, and platform goals.
- If task requirements conflict with mission context → stop and generate clarifying questions.

### 2. Confidence Score Workflow
**Confidence Score (0–100%):**
- If <100% → do not execute. Instead:
  - List areas of uncertainty.
  - Generate clarifying questions.
  - Await user input.
  - Recalculate confidence.
- If 100% → proceed with deliverable generation.

**Explanation Required:** Always explain why the score was chosen. If <100%, include explicit questions.

### 3. Tenant Isolation & Security
- Every action, query, schema, log, and notification must be scoped by tenant_id.
- Cross-tenant access is forbidden, even in examples or test cases.
- Customer profiles are tenant-specific. If the same individual books with two businesses, two distinct profiles are created.

### 4. Payments & Bookings
Bookings are valid only when fully paid:
- Credit card required (even if "cash" selected, to enforce no-show fee).
- Gift card/coupon must cover full amount. If partial, balance requires credit card.
- No booking can be confirmed without complete payment success.
- Payments and booking creation must be atomic, idempotent, and deterministic.

### 5. Availability Rules
- Admin (owner) must define weekly availability blocks (1-hour increments).
- Availability is always required; without it, booking pages display:
  "Online booking isn't available for <Business Name> at this time."
- Exceptions (buffers, holidays) must be manually configured and take effect immediately.

### 6. Branding & White-Labeling
- All customer-facing outputs are tenant-branded.
- If branding data missing → fallback:
  - Business name in clean black & white font, optional gradients, professional style.
  - No Tithi mention.

### 7. Notifications
- Automatic booking confirmation (email + SMS) sent post-booking.
- All other reminders/follow-ups are manual in v1.
- Notifications must never duplicate.
- Admin can configure message content and timing.

### 8. Error Handling & Observability
- Errors must follow Tithi error codes with human-readable and machine-readable formats.
- All operations must log structured metadata: tenant_id, booking_id, payment_id, etc.
- Include observability hooks for tracing, metrics, and debugging.

### 9. Idempotency & Determinism
- All tasks must be idempotent (same inputs = same outputs).
- No unintended side effects on re-execution.
- Transactions must be deterministic.

### 10. Test Coverage
Generate unit + integration tests for:
- Tenant isolation enforcement.
- Booking/payment rules.
- Notifications.
- CRUD flows for tenant-specific entities.

### 11. Human-Readable Deliverable Summary
Before generating technical outputs, provide a short plain-language explanation of what the deliverable is and how it fits Tithi's mission.

### 12. Environment Defaults
- Development: local DB, dummy Stripe, emails → console.
- Staging: test DB, test Stripe, emails → test addresses.
- Production: real DB, real Stripe, real emails.

Always confirm the environment context before generating.

### 13. Future-Proofing
If task implementation involves assumptions that may change in v2+ (e.g., staff roles, recurring bookings, saved availability templates, alternative payments), flag them for future consideration.

## Phase 1 — Foundation Setup

### Task 1.1: Backend Project Scaffold
**Context:** Initialize backend repo with Python 3.11, Flask blueprints, Supabase/Postgres integration, Alembic migrations, and directory layout.

**Deliverable:** 
- Repo initialized with Flask app factory pattern
- Config for environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Supabase client integration
- Directory layout: `/api`, `/models`, `/services`, `/migrations`

**Constraints:**
- Must use Python 3.11
- Alembic migrations required for schema
- Config must be 12-factor compliant

**Inputs/Outputs:**
- Input: N/A
- Output: Running Flask app with "/health" endpoint

**Validation:** `GET /health` returns 200 with `{status: "ok"}`

**Testing:**
- Unit: health check returns 200
- Integration: app runs locally with Postgres

**Dependencies:** None

**Executive Rationale:** This establishes the foundational scaffolding for the backend. Without a proper project structure, later atomic tasks risk inconsistency, duplication, or brittle integration.

**North-Star Invariants:**
- The backend must always boot successfully in all environments
- All configs must be externalized (never hardcoded)

**Contract Tests (Black-box):** Given a running backend container, When a request is made to GET /health, Then the response must be 200 and include {status: "ok"}.

**Schema/DTO Freeze Note:** No schemas introduced here; DTOs frozen at future tasks.

**Observability Hooks:**
- Log "BACKEND_BOOTED" with env and timestamp
- Metric: `backend_startup_duration_ms`

**Error Model Enforcement:** `TITHI_BOOT_FAILURE` if environment variables missing

**Idempotency & Retry Guarantee:** Not applicable (setup task)

---

### Task 1.2: Database Initialization
**Context:** Setup Postgres schema with tenant isolation, RLS enabled. Provides core tables for tenants, users, and base metadata.

**Deliverable:**
- Alembic migration creating `tenants`, `users`, `roles`
- RLS enabled on all tenant tables

**Constraints:**
- Must enforce tenant_id scoping
- Primary keys = UUID v4

**Inputs/Outputs:**
- Input: Migration execution
- Output: Database schema

**Validation:**
- Tables created with RLS ON
- Queries without tenant_id denied

**Testing:**
- Attempt select without tenant_id → denied
- Insert with tenant_id → success

**Dependencies:** Task 1.1

**Executive Rationale:** This guarantees multi-tenant isolation from day one. Prevents data leaks and underpins compliance with privacy regulations.

**North-Star Invariants:**
- No tenant may read/write another tenant's data
- Every row in a tenant-scoped table must have tenant_id

**Contract Tests (Black-box):** Given tenant A and tenant B exist, When a user from tenant A queries users table, Then no rows belonging to tenant B are returned.

**Schema/DTO Freeze Note:** `tenants`, `users`, `roles` schemas frozen after this task.

**Observability Hooks:** Emit `DB_SCHEMA_MIGRATION_APPLIED` event with migration_id

**Error Model Enforcement:** `TITHI_DB_RLS_VIOLATION` for queries violating RLS

**Idempotency & Retry Guarantee:** Alembic migrations must be idempotent; re-running applies no changes

---

### Task 1.3: Multi-Environment Config
**Context:** Configure environment handling for dev/staging/prod with secrets management.

**Deliverable:**
- `.env` support with dotenv
- Config loader for per-env secrets

**Constraints:**
- No secrets in repo

**Inputs/Outputs:**
- Input: ENV vars
- Output: Flask app configured

**Validation:** Missing secrets → error

**Testing:** Run app with missing DB_URL → fails

**Dependencies:** Task 1.1

**Executive Rationale:** Ensures secure, environment-specific deployment. Prevents secret leakage into code and makes scaling predictable.

**North-Star Invariants:**
- Secrets must never be hardcoded
- Each env config must fully resolve before app starts

**Contract Tests (Black-box):** Given no DB_URL in env, When backend boots, Then it fails with TITHI_BOOT_FAILURE.

**Schema/DTO Freeze Note:** No schema introduced.

**Observability Hooks:** Emit `CONFIG_LOADED` with env_name

**Error Model Enforcement:** `TITHI_BOOT_FAILURE` → missing secrets

**Idempotency & Retry Guarantee:** Configs loaded once per boot

---

## Phase 2 — Authentication & Authorization

### Task 2.1: JWT Auth Setup
**Context:** Implement authentication with JWT, including tenant_id claims. Provides the base for secure access control.

**Deliverable:**
- JWT encode/decode with secret
- Middleware to inject tenant_id from JWT

**Constraints:**
- JWT expiry = 1h
- Refresh tokens implemented

**Inputs/Outputs:**
- Input: {username, password}
- Output: {access_token, refresh_token}

**Validation:**
- Valid creds → token returned
- Invalid → 401

**Testing:** Decode token → tenant_id claim correct

**Dependencies:** Task 1.2

**Executive Rationale:** JWT with tenant_id enables secure, scoped access control. Critical for ensuring every request is tied to the correct tenant.

**North-Star Invariants:**
- Tenant_id claim must always be present
- Expired tokens must always fail

**Contract Tests (Black-box):** Given a valid user, When they request a token, Then response includes access_token with tenant_id claim.

**Schema/DTO Freeze Note:** `auth_tokens` DTO frozen.

**Observability Hooks:**
- Emit `AUTH_LOGIN_SUCCESS` and `AUTH_LOGIN_FAIL`

**Error Model Enforcement:**
- `TITHI_AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS`
- `TITHI_AUTH_EXPIRED_TOKEN`

**Idempotency & Retry Guarantee:** Token generation idempotent per login

---

### Task 2.2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Context:** Enforce roles (owner, admin, staff, customer). RBAC ensures correct privilege boundaries.

**Deliverable:**
- Middleware enforcing role checks
- DB schema for roles per user

**Constraints:** Each user has exactly 1 role per tenant

**Inputs/Outputs:**
- Input: API request with JWT
- Output: allow/deny

**Validation:**
- Owner can manage staff
- Staff cannot change roles

**Testing:** Try staff → create tenant = 403

**Dependencies:** Task 2.1

**Executive Rationale:** Role isolation ensures security boundaries between tenant staff and customers. Prevents privilege escalation.

**North-Star Invariants:**
- Customers must never access admin endpoints
- Owners always retain ultimate authority

**Contract Tests (Black-box):** Given a staff user, When they attempt to create a new tenant, Then they receive 403 Forbidden.

**Schema/DTO Freeze Note:** `roles` schema frozen.

**Observability Hooks:** Emit `RBAC_DENIED` log with user_id, endpoint

**Error Model Enforcement:** `TITHI_AUTH_FORBIDDEN_ROLE`

**Idempotency & Retry Guarantee:** RBAC checks deterministic, no side effects

- Output: tenant record + subdomain

**Validation:** Duplicate subdomain → error

**Testing:** Register → accessible at `<tenant>.tithi.com`

**Dependencies:** Task 1.2, Task 2.1

**Executive Rationale:** Onboarding is the entry point for businesses, defining brand, policies, and subdomain. Foundation for white-label promise.

**North-Star Invariants:**
- No two tenants share subdomain
- Onboarding must always result in functional tenant

**Contract Tests (Black-box):** Given a business registers with subdomain "spa123", When another tries same subdomain, Then system must reject with 409 conflict.

**Schema/DTO Freeze Note:** `tenants` schema extended, frozen post-task.

**Observability Hooks:** Emit `TENANT_ONBOARDED` with tenant_id, subdomain

**Error Model Enforcement:** `TITHI_TENANT_DUPLICATE_SUBDOMAIN`

**Idempotency & Retry Guarantee:** Registration idempotent per email/subdomain
