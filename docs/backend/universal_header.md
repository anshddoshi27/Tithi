## 0. Mission Context & Core Platform Vision

### 0.1 Core Mission Statement
**Tithi is an end-to-end, fully white-labeled platform for service-based businesses** (salons, clinics, studios) to launch their own branded booking systems in minutes. Every tenant (business) has its own subdomain (business.tithi.com) or custom domain, and customers booking services only see the business's brand, logo, colors, policies—not "Tithi" (unless explicitly chosen).

Tithi replaces multiple tools by offering onboarding, branding, bookings, payments, policies, notifications, CRM, analytics — all within one modular platform.

**CRITICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENT:**
This project requires comprehensive multi-document consultation before any implementation. Do not assume you understand requirements from task descriptions alone. You must consult the design brief, context pack, and TITHI_DATABASE_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md to fully understand all goals, architectural decisions, API patterns, and business requirements. Prioritize thoroughness over speed in requirements gathering. This is a multi-document project requiring cross-reference to ensure 100% compliance with all authoritative documents. The database report is essential for accurate backend integration and alignment with Tithi's spirit and functionalities.



### 0.2 Platform Architecture Overview
Tithi is a white-labeled, multi-tenant booking platform where each tenant (business) has:
- **Isolated data** with complete separation between business data
- **Own branding** with businesses appearing 100% independent 
- **Customer-facing experiences** under their domain
- **Prepaid bookings** via Stripe with full payment validation
- **Professional branding defaults** with deterministic backend workflows

### 0.3 North Star Goals (Critical Success Factors)
- **Strict tenant data isolation** - Complete separation between business data
- **Full tenant-controlled branding** - Businesses appear 100% independent 
- **Owner/Admin only** (no staff roles in v1) - Simplified role model for initial release
- **Bookings require full payment validation** - No unpaid bookings allowed
- **Availability must always be defined** for booking to function
- **Secure, observable, and deterministic backend execution** - Production-ready reliability

**All atomic tasks must align with this mission, context pack, and design brief.**

## 1. Enhanced Platform Goals & Requirements

**CRITICAL: TITHI_DATABASE_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md is the single source of truth for all database schemas, constraints, indexes, relationships, migrations, and backend alignment. No deliverable should ever contradict or drift from this file.AFTER BUILDING CHECK THAT DATABASE IS FULLY COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT YOU JUST BUILT (THINK OF RELEVANT TABLES AND OVERALL SCHEMA AND HOW IT WOULD WORK WITH THE NEW ADDITION)**

## 7. Phase Context & Task Management

### 7.1 Phase ENDGOALS (tasks makeup phases)
## PRIORITIZED ACTION PLAN




### 7.2 Reference to Backend Report & Historical Files
**Authoritative Sources**: Before execution, the executor must read and cross-reference backend_report.md and all previously generated files for this project.

**Purpose**: Ensure continuity, avoid re-implementing already delivered components, and preserve consistency across phases.

**Scope**:
- Review completed modules, migrations, API specs, and config files already defined
- Cross-check existing deliverables before generating new ones
- If inconsistencies or unclear overlaps are found, lower the confidence score and ask clarifying questions before proceeding

**Rule**: The backend report and historical artifacts act as the state of record for what is implemented to date. No changes or assumptions should be made without reconciling against these files.

**Execution Impact**: Executor must integrate new work with existing structure, not overwrite it blindly.

### 7.3 Backend Report Documentation Requirements
**CRITICAL: Every executor MUST append detailed implementation steps to backend_report.md after completing any task.**

#### 7.3.1 Mandatory Documentation Standards
- **File Location**: `backend_report.md` (root directory)
- **Update Frequency**: After EVERY task completion
- **Detail Level**: Comprehensive step-by-step implementation record
- **Format**: Follow existing report structure and formatting

#### 7.3.2 Required Documentation Sections for Each Task
For every task completed, the executor MUST append the following sections to backend_report.md:

**A. Task Implementation Header**
```markdown

2. **During Implementation**: Take notes of all changes, decisions, and issues
3. **After Task Completion**: Immediately append comprehensive documentation to backend_report.md
4. **Validation**: Ensure all changes are properly documented and traceable

#### 7.3.5 Critical Success Factors
- **No Task Completion Without Documentation**: Every task must be fully documented
- **Real-Time Updates**: Documentation must be updated immediately after task completion
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every file, change, decision, and issue must be recorded
- **Professional Quality**: Documentation must meet professional standards for maintainability
- **Future Reference**: Documentation must enable future developers to understand and build upon the work

**ENFORCEMENT**: Any executor who fails to properly document their implementation steps in backend_report.md will be considered to have not completed the task successfully, regardless of code quality or functionality.

### 7.4 Task Placement
Every atomic prompt will contain a **Task Definition Block** (see Section 8). This is the *only* source of truth for what the executor should deliver in this run. 

- If missing or ambiguous → lower confidence, ask clarifying questions
- If present and unambiguous → treat it as authoritative

### 7.5 Confidence Score Workflow
- Confidence Score (0–100%) must be declared
- If <100%: stop execution, list reasons for doubt, and ask clarifying questions
- If 100%: explain why, then proceed with generation
- No code or deliverables may be produced below 100%

## 8. Task Definition Block (Embedded Atomic Task)
